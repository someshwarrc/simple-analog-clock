# Simple-analog-clock
## This is a really simple analog clock made with HTML,CSS and JS. 

HTML **SVG** is created using [SVG-Edit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit) with a little CSS and front-end javascript DOM manipulation.

To present this as a simple express app I have initialized with npm.

You must be having [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) in your system.

Just type `npm install` and then run the app using `node server.js` in your terminal.
